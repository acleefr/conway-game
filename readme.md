# Conway's Game of Life

This repository contains an implementation of Conway's Game of Life in Python.

## Description

Conway's Game of Life is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970. It is a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input. One interacts with the Game of Life by creating an initial configuration and observing how it evolves.

## Features

- Random initialization of the grid
- Visualization of the grid using matplotlib
- Implementation of the rules of Conway's Game of Life

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- matplotlib library

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Run the main script `conway_game_of_life.py`:

```bash
python conway_game_of_life.py
```

This will start the simulation and display the evolution of the grid using matplotlib.
